# 🌸 Disha’s AI Chatbot (Practice Project)

This is a simple AI chatbot project I built during my free time to explore how frontend and backend communicate with an AI model.
The goal of this project was learning and experimentation, not building a production-ready system.

## It helped me understand:

- How a frontend sends requests to a backend
- How FastAPI handles APIs
- How conversation memory works in chatbots
- How to connect an AI model to a real UI

This project was created mainly for fun, curiosity, and hands-on practice ✨

## ✨ Features

- Simple chat UI using HTML, Tailwind CSS & JavaScript
- Backend built with FastAPI (Python)
- AI responses powered by OpenAI
- Basic conversation memory (remembers previous messages)
- Clean and beginner-friendly code structure

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

Frontend: HTML, Tailwind CSS, JavaScript
Backend: Python, FastAPI
AI: OpenAI API
Others: REST APIs, CORS, dotenv

## 🚀 How It Works (High Level)

User types a message in the browser

Frontend sends the message to a FastAPI backend

Backend sends the conversation (with memory) to the AI model

AI response is returned and shown in the UI

## 🧠 Learning Outcome

This project helped me:

Understand full-stack flow in a simple way

Learn how chatbots maintain conversation context

Get comfortable working with APIs

Build confidence before moving to larger projects

## ⚠️ Disclaimer

This is a simple learning project:

Memory is stored in server RAM (resets on restart)

No authentication or database

Not intended for production use

## 💭 Why I Built This

Sometimes the best projects are the ones you build just to learn and enjoy.
This chatbot is one of those projects 😊
